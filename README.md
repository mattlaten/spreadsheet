Matt's Spreadsheet Processor
===================================================

Thank you for using Matt's spreadsheet processsor.

You currently have a copy of the Eclipse project and source files (located in
"src"), which can be built inside Eclipse or imported into IntelliJ. The code
can still be compiled using the standard Oracle Java 7 compiler (tested).

An example of an csv input file is available in "input/in1".

The main method for this application exists inside the class named "Main".
